# Image_Classification_Task
## Make This task in Keras Bulid in tensorFlow
* This task is working with 2 Types of data 
  - First one : Cifar dataset and I try to select only Cats , Dogs , and Cars.
  - seconde one : Raw Data set ( Dogs , Cats , and Cars ) and I work with flow_from_directory  and use generator to generate pickles for model
    - In this area you can run only first Cell and last one because last run of the model has accuracy 70 % with 10 epochs only
